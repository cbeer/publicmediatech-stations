== Public Media Tech: Gallery of Station Websites

This is a quick prototype project to aggregate and analyze the public media websites (loosely defined). Using a bunch of off-the-shelf Ruby on Rails plugins and gems, here is a very basic, very ugly gallery interface for that data.

Please feel free to fork this project and send pull requests to add design or functionality.
